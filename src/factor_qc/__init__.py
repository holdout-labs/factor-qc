"""factor-qc: fail-closed quality gate for backtests.

One numpy-only engine for the standard backtest-overfit statistics —Deflated Sharpe Ratio, Probability of Backtest Overfitting (CSCV),
Harvey-Liu multiple-testing haircut, Minimum Track Record Length —wrapped
in a gate that refuses to judge a backtest that does not declare how many
configurations were tried.
